Thanks a lot for downloading!

This is a commandline version of the Blackjack game
tested and compatible with Ruby 1.8.7

It implements basic features like Hit, Stand, Split and Double.
The game initally prompts the user to select the number of
players on the table and then for the starting cash which
will be the same for each player.

Then, it asks each player to enter the bet amount in a round-robin
fashion. Finally, it plays Blackjack with each player, again, in
a round-robin fashion. Once each player finishes the round, the
dealer deals cards to itself, if needed and computes the winnings
of each player depending on it's own and the player's hand values.

When the round is over, it prompts if the user wants to play another
round. In that case, all remaining balance for each player becomes
the starting balance for the next round. Note that the number of
players remains the same for each round and is only determined
once, when the game is first started. Also, if a player runs out of
cash, a loan shark restores the balance to the starting cash
value.



RUNNING

Enter the src directory, and then typing

	ruby Blackjack.rb

on the command prompt should do the trick


WARNING

N = 4

1. Has some subtle Harry Potter references that may not go down well
with every user.
2. This is my best work, given:
   * I took N days to complete this code
   * I had no idea of how Blackjack is played
     and had to additionally learn the rules of
     the game within the N day period
   * I was familiar with Ruby but was yet to
     write a serious program until this one


Enjoy the game!

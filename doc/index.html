<p>
This is a commandline version of the Blackjack game tested and compatible
with Ruby 1.8.7
</p>
<p>
It implements basic features like Hit, Stand, Split and Double. The game
initally prompts the user to select the number of players on the table and
then for the starting cash which will be the same for each player.
</p>
<p>
Then, it asks each player to enter the bet amount in a round-robin fashion.
Finally, it plays Blackjack with each player, again, in a round-robin
fashion. Once each player finishes the round, the dealer deals cards to
itself, if needed and computes the winnings of each player depending on
it&#8217;s own and the player&#8217;s hand values.
</p>
<p>
When the round is over, it prompts if the user wants to play another round.
In that case, all remaining balance for each player becomes the starting
balance for the next round. Note that the number of players remains the
same for each round and is only determined once, when the game is first
started. Also, if a player runs out of cash, a loan shark restores the
balance to the starting cash value.
</p>
<p>
RUNNING
</p>
<p>
Enter the src directory, and then typing
</p>
<pre class="code">
        <span class='rubyid_ruby identifier id'>ruby</span> <span class='rubyid_Blackjack constant id'>Blackjack</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='rubyid_rb identifier id'>rb</span>
</pre>
<p>
on the command prompt should do the trick

<p>
with every user.
</p>
<ol>
<li>This is my best work, given:

<ul>
<li>I took 3 days to complete this code

</li>
<li>I had no idea of how Blackjack is played and had to additionally learn the
rules of the game within the 3 day period

</li>
<li>I was familiar with Ruby but was yet to write a serious program until this
one

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Enjoy the game!
